This is the source code behind the website [cloviskyndt.com](https://cloviskyndt.com). I update this resume from time to time and try new technologies.

## Details

- The app is based on 3 generics components (Block, Table, Text), the drawing is determined by the locale en.json file and wrapped with a layout.
